<h1>‚ùì Purpose of the project:</h1>

<div>
    <p>
        This project was developed to create a dynamic and interactive Spider-Man mask filter using Python. Its main goal is to demonstrate the ability to apply computer vision techniques to overlay a mask on a user's face in real-time. The project serves as an example of combining facial landmark detection with image processing.
        <br><br>
        The filter adjusts the mask's position, scale, and rotation dynamically based on facial landmarks detected in the video feed. This application highlights practical uses of computer vision libraries like MediaPipe and OpenCV to create engaging user experiences.
        <br><br>
        Please note that this project is intended for educational and entertainment purposes. It showcases the potential of augmented reality technologies in building fun and creative applications.

  <h1>ü§ñ The Process:</h1>
    <p>
        During the development of this filter mask project, several challenges were encountered, particularly in aligning the mask with the detected facial landmarks. Solving these issues involved learning advanced concepts in image transformations and real-time video processing.
        <br><br>
        The process required integrating MediaPipe for facial landmark detection and using OpenCV to manipulate images and overlays dynamically. The iterative development approach provided a valuable learning experience in combining different technologies for an interactive application.
